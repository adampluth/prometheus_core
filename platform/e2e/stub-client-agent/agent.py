"""
Stub client-agent for the frontend's end-to-end tests.

It stands in for the real client-agent in the e2e stack (docker-compose.e2e.yml),
so the tests can drive a chat through the real backend, nginx and browser without
an LLM. It speaks the same A2A protocol through PrometheusAgent and answers with
the same ConversationResponse shape, but picks its reply from the prompt instead
of reasoning about it:

- a prompt naming "mesh", "ifc" or "diagram" gets an answer with that sample as an
  artifact, the way a specialist agent's output reaches the user;
- anything else gets a fixed text answer.

The mesh and IFC samples are served over plain HTTP on SAMPLES_PORT, and the
artifact's uri points there. The backend downloads http:// artifacts itself, so it
converts the STL to the mesh viewer's VTP as it would a real one. The samples are
public test files, so that port takes no bearer token; the A2A port keeps the
agent's usual auth. The Mermaid sample travels inline, as Mermaid artifacts do.

It skips one step of the SDK's request lifecycle: the execution record every agent
writes to DeepLynx before running. The e2e stack has no DeepLynx, and the stub
stores nothing, so there's nothing to record. Everything else (A2A parsing, bearer
auth, the identity token, streaming, finalization) is the SDK's own.
