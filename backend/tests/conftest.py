"""Shared fixtures for the backend test suite.

Admin-plane tests (users, OIDC providers, signing keys) never touch a real
Postgres -- ``db_session`` gives each test its own in-memory SQLite engine
with the ORM schema created directly from ``Base.metadata`` (bypassing
Alembic, which is the production migration path; see ``app/db.py``).

Valkey-backed state (the session store, the SSE event bus, session revocation) is
served by ``fakeredis`` rather than a container. ``valkey_state`` is autouse: every
test gets ``app.state.redis`` / ``session_store`` / ``event_bus`` wired to a fresh
in-memory instance, because a bare ``TestClient(app)`` does not run the lifespan that
normally builds them. Ask for the ``session_store``, ``fake_redis`` or ``event_bus``
fixture to reach the objects that were installed.
