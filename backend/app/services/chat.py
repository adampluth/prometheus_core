"""Chat turn orchestration — the inverted, non-blocking loop (decision D1).

Ports the turn logic from ``frontend/components/message_handler.py`` while
dropping Chainlit's blocking waits and server-side rendering:

- The Chainlit handler *blocked* inside one turn — it awaited a ``cl.Step``
  through streaming, then awaited an ``AskElementMessage`` / ``AskActionMessage``
  for follow-ups and plan approval, recursing on the same call stack. Here every
  turn is a single ``POST`` that returns as soon as the agent produces a terminal
  ``ConversationResponse``. Follow-up answers and plan approval/rejection arrive
  as the *next* ``POST`` (carrying ``followup_answers`` / ``plan_approved`` /
  ``plan_rejected``), which ``A2AClient.send`` already supports.
- Live status no longer updates a ``cl.Step``; the caller's ``on_status`` closure
  publishes a :class:`StatusEvent` onto the session event bus (task 05).
- Artifacts are shaped into :class:`ArtifactMeta` (task 07's builder) rather than
  rendered into Chainlit elements.

The mapping between ``prometheus_api``'s ``ConversationResponse`` and our wire
:class:`ChatMessageResponse` lives entirely in :func:`map_response`.
